## IDEs, compilers, interfaces

- IDEs, integrated development environments
- CLI, command-line interface
- code hello.c, to create a new file called hello.c
- compile program: make hello
- run program: ./hello
- file name with an asterisk,\*,to indicate that it's executable, or that we can run it.

## main, header files, commands

- commands:
  - cd, for changing our current directory(folder). We can go up tow levels at once with cd ../.. 
  - cp, for copying files and directories
  - ls, for listing files in a directory
  - mkdir, for making a directory
  - mv, for moving(renaming) files and directories
  - rm, for removing(deleting) files
  - rmdir, for removing(deleting) directories
- clean the terminal window:
  - clean 
  - contrl + L

## Calculations
- In the terminal window, we can also start typing commands like make ca, and then press the tab key for the terminal to automatically complete our command. The up and down arrows also allow us to see previous commands and run them without typing them again.

## Constant

- const int MINE = 2;  \# The const keyword tells our compiler to ensure that the value of this variable isn't changed, and by convention the name of the variable should be in all upper case.


## or ||  and &&
- In C, a char is surrounded y single quotes, ', instead of double quotes for strings.

## Loops, functions
- We define our function with void meow(void). The first void means that there isn't a return value for our function. The void within the parentheses also indicates that the function doesn't take any arguments, or inputs.

## Imprecision, overflow
- Specify the number of decimal places displayed: %.5f
